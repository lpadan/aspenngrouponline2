				<p>This collection of amenities and services includes a welcoming arrival lobby and lounge with a front desk, concierge service, valet parking, and storage for package delivery and luggage. Guests can check in for their stay and enlist the help of the concierge for coordinating numerous activities throughout the greater Park City area.</p>

				<p>The on-site restaurant & bar offers casual contemporary dining for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Adjacent to the Ruby express chairlift, the restaurant's western-facing ski beach patio will be the premier location for owners and guests to enjoy those warm sun-drenched spring ski afternoons.</p>

				<p>Sommet Blanc features a slopeside pool and patio with multiple hot tubs and outdoor gathering spaces. With a strong focus on indoor/outdoor living, the pool will be a popular amenity for both winter and summer stays. The pool locker rooms include saunas and also service the fitness center.

				<p>As one of the essential features for ski property, residents will begin and end their ski day in the spacious ski locker room. The Sommet Blanc ski lockers are precisely designed to accommodate each Residence's various sizes and the number of guests each unit houses. The on-site ski valet can help store skis, boots, poles and provide assistance gearing up for the day. Additionally, they can provide ski rental equipment, demo skis, and services, including waxing, sharpening, and complete ski tunes. Forgot goggles or gloves? Need a new helmet? No problem, they can get you dialed in.</p>

				<p>The après-ski lounge is unlike any other in Deer Valley. Numerous social gathering spaces anchored by two large fireplaces encourage guests to meet up and share stories of the ski day. The live-in Resident Managers will host daily après-ski happy hours for owners and their guests. The indoor lounge opens up to an expansive outdoor patio with fire pits - yet another western-facing, sunny place to relax. And for the kids, adjacent to the après-ski lounge is a children's activity playroom. A perfect place for the younger ones to gather and play games, puzzles, draw/color or watch a movie - all within sight of the parents.</p>

				<p>Also located near the après-ski lounge is an executive boardroom ideal for planning a small corporate retreat or business meeting. The smaller guest office provides a quiet space to step away for a quick call or return a few emails</p>

				<p>After a day of skiing and a relaxing dinner, the fun is not over. Sommet Blanc also features a four-lane bowling alley with an arcade lounge. What better way to spend time with friends and family? More catered for the adults, head over to watch a game at the speakeasy or try your hand at one of two golf simulators.</p>

				<p>Even the garage is an essential space at Sommet Blanc. The heated, underground parking garage includes one reserved space for each Residence, plus additional guest spaces for overflow parking. A unique feature of this property is the design of large storage spaces with roll-up doors adjacent to your parking space. There is plenty of storage for skis, bikes, golf clubs, etc. - all within easy loading to your car. And yet, another innovative way Sommet Blanc sets itself apart, the building is pre-wired for the option of including car charging stations for each Residence. Electric vehicles are rapidly on the rise. Charging stations will be a critical necessity in the very near future, and they are extremely difficult to retrofit into existing buildings</p>

				<p>The Alpine Villas enjoy the ski chalet with spacious ski lockers, lounge area, and outdoor patio, as well as storage for Sommet Blanc's private ski trail grooming machine.</p>

				<p>Live-in Residence Managers offer ease of ownership with full-service property management, property rental management, and concierge services.</p>
