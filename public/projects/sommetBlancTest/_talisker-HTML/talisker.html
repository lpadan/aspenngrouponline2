				<br>
				<p class="sub-heading">TALISKER TOWER</p>

				<p>Nestled in the heart of Empire Pass, Talisker Club Members’ private clubhouse is sumptuous and grand, more of an elegant lounge than a ski lodge accessed by Silver Strike Express lift at Deer Valley Resort.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">EMPIRE MEMBER'S SKI LODGE</p>

				<p>Offering easy ski-in/ski-out access to Ruby, Empire and Lady Morgan lifts at Deer Valley, the Members’ ski lodge, adjacent to the Empire day lodge, offers a convenient portal to the mountain and place to relax without leaving the hill.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">THE OUTPOST</p>

				<p>This high-altitude playground is the hub for snowshoeing, skate skiing, tubing and an array of backcountry adventures including snowmobiling and more. Accessible only by snowcat, Outpost excursions are made even more memorable by the prospects of privately catered meals inside the rustic yurt by Talisker’s exceptional culinary team.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">TALISKER CLUB PARK</p>

				<p>At the heart of Tuhaye and situated near the 10th tee of Talisker Golf at Tuhaye, Talisker Club Park is the ultimate experience in relaxation and activity. Open year-round, Talisker Club Park features the Tuhaye Clubhouse, the Golf Clubhouse, a family pool and fitness center, a bite to eat at the Table Café or spectacular spa treatments, all just steps away from the delightful Wildstar Cabin.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">TUHAYE GOLF</p>

				<p>Talisker Golf at Tuhaye offers an unparalleled golf experience with panoramic views of Deer Valley® Resort, Mt. Timpanogos and the blue waters of the Jordanelle Reservoir. The Mark O’Meara designed Signature Course was recently recognized by Golf Digest as one of the Top 10 “Best New Private Courses” in America.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">TENNIS</p>

				<p>Located just east of Talisker Club Park, the Tennis Courts feature two Har-Tru clay surface courts that provide the most desirable conditions for players. The granular surface acts as a shock-absorbing cushion, allowing players to slide into their returns and reduce stress on the legs.</p>

				<p class="sub-heading">BOATING</p>

				<p>Members can book boating adventure and let Talisker Club captains command the Talisker Toy, Talisker Club’s Mastercraft X45, for an unforgettable outing of wakeboarding, waterskiing, tubing, surfing and/or leisure cruising on the sparkling waters of the Jordanelle Reservoir.</p>
